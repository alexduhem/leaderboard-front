## Disclaimer 
First time I used Angular so far, I did it for the sake of the interview without any specific architecture or beautiful design.
A lot of improvements has to be made (error handling, loading feedback, etc)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
